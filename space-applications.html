                                                communications. Satellite links are the primary means of connectivity to remote and far flung regions of the country
                                                and they are the backup links for large number of terrestrial connectivity in the mainland.

                                            <p>Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSATs) networks are designed to support all kinds of applications supporting video,
                                                voice and data, with a wide range of data rates from few kilobits per second (kbps) to 8 megabits per seconds
                                                (mbps). A VSAT network comprises of a central hub and hundreds of terminals which are further interfaced to
                                                computers and other peripheral devices. The hub acts as a gateway with interface to external connectivity and
                                                several application servers. Rapid technological advancements and reduction in the cost of user equipment are
                                                increasing the popularity of VSAT network. A VSAT network works out to be a cheaper option while establishing a
                                                network to cover a wide geographical area, state wide or nationwide. VSAT networks operate in C, Extended C and

                                                computer conferencing, web-based instructions, etc. EDUSAT had manifold objectives - to supplement the
                                                curriculum-based teaching, imparting effective teacher training, providing access to quality resource persons and
                                                new technologies, thus finally resulting in taking education to every nook and corner of India. EDUSAT provided
                                                connectivity to schools, colleges and higher levels of education and also supported non-formal education including

                                            <p>EDUSAT Programme was implemented in three phases: pilot, semi-operational and operational phases. Pilot projects were
                                                conducted during 2004 in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh with 300 terminals. The experiences of pilot
                                                projects were adopted in semi-operational phase. During semi- operational phase, almost all the states and major
                                                national agencies were covered under EDUSAT programme.

                                            <p>The networks implemented under EDUSAT programme comprise of two types of terminals, namely, Satellite Interactive
                                                Terminals (SITs) and Receive Only Terminals (ROTs). Many states have expressed their keen interest to upgrade their

                                            <h4>GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN)</h4>
                                            <p>The implementation of GAGAN has numerous benefits to the aviation sector in terms of fuel saving, saving in equipment
                                                cost, flight safety, increased air space capacity, efficiency, enhancement of reliability, reduction in workload for
                                                operators, coverage of oceanic area for air traffic control, high position accuracy, etc. Directorate General of
                                                Civil Aviation (DGCA) certified GAGAN for enroute services (RNP 0.1) on the December 30, 2013 and further certified
                                                for precision approach (APV 1) on April 21, 2015. With this, GAGAN signal is available for both civil Aviation and
                                                Non-Aviation users. GAGAN Payloads are operational through GSAT-8, GSAT-10 and GSAT-15 satellites.

                                                </li>
                                                <li>Global seamless navigation for all phases of flight including arrival, departure, oceanic and en route</li>
                                                <li>Allow direct routings, multiple approaches resulting in considerable fuel savings to airlines and provide for
